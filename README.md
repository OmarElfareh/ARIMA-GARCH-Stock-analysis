# ARIMA-GARCH-Stock-analysis
Modeling the stock returns and volatility of Equinor using ARIMA and GARCH for the course ECON4165 Applied Time Series Analysis: Econometrics and Machine Learning. 

This paper focuses on investigating the predictive accuracy of Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models in forecasting future returns and volatility of Equinor. Equinor is a predominant company listed on the Euronext Growth market and majority-owned by the Norwegian government. The study aims to assess the models’ performance in captur- ing the underlying dynamics of the company’s stock returns and examine their potential application for investment and risk management purposes. The paper provides a procedure, influenced by the Box-Jenkins approach, that proposes fitting ARIMA and GARCH models and then evaluates the models ́ prediction accuracy.
